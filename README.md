# Conference Planning

Welcome to the conferences repo for EMC {code}.  This is where we focus on conference planning.  Since we are committed to transparency and collaboration, all information relating to where, who, and what we are submitting for conferences is here!

- The [wiki](https://github.com/emccode/conferences/wiki) contains a calendar of conference events that we are planning on submitting ideas for or attending
- We use [milestones](https://github.com/emccode/conferences/milestones) as a framework for ensuring we propose relevant topics.
- [Labels](https://github.com/emccode/conferences/labels) track where we are in the submission process for events whether proposed, submitted, or accepted.
